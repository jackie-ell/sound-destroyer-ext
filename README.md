# Sound Destroyer Chrome Extension (WIP)

### Objective
To create a Chrome extension that stops annoying, unexpected noises, such as loud video advertisements.

### TODO:
* Create an icon
* Remove some code redundancies 🤷‍♀️
* Make trusted sites format indifferent (unopinionated)

## What it does
Mutes tabs that are:
* Making noise!
* Not your current, active tab
* Not part of your "trusted sites" list

## What are "trusted sites"? How do I use them?
Trusted sites are websites that you want to make background noise.
Ex: listening to a song on youtube while you browse another tab.

You can add a trusted site by clicking on the extension icon and using the popup interface.

Trusted sites are opinionated and must follow the "www.somewhere.com" format.
